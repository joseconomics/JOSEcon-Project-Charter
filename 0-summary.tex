The Journal of Open Source Economics (JOSEcon) publishes ``code papers'' written by 
code developers in the field of economics. 

In addition to documenting valuable tools, the immediate goal of publishing
coding work is to enable indexing and collection of citations by its authors,
thus allowing for quality coding work to be credited in a manner similar to
traditional publications.  More boadly, JOSEcon promotes best software
engineering practices in economics, thereby building the computational
economics community.  It is also working together with traditional journals to
help the review process for papers that rely heavily on computations.  

The field that has already build some mass of people aware and interested in
better software development is computational macro, which has the majority of
existing coding projects like QuantEcon or Econ-ARK.  But JOSEcon covers all
fields of economics and econometrics that require computational methods, such
as microeconometrics and structural econometrics, empirical IO, life cycle
modeling, Bayesian econometrics, computational game theory, and so on. 

The journal is the economics field specific version of The Journal of Open
Source Software (JOSS) and inherits its main principles: open publication of
open source code with an open review process.
